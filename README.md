# my-first-repo

My Name is Luis Abreu and I'm a software engineering fellow at The Marcy Lab School. I was born, raised, and currently reside in Brooklyn, NY, and my family originates from the Dominican Republic. I look forward to discovering the practical applications for computer science and seeing what connections it may have to one of my passions, 3D printing.
